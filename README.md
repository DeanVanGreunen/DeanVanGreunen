### Hi there

I'm Dean, a Senior Software Engineer.

I work on Full Stack Web, Mobile and Desktop Applications.

Started coding at the ripe age of 11 starting off with C, C++ then moved into web technologies such as Javascript, HTML, CSS and PHP.

Later in life, I've gotten tons of experience using those technologies as well as learning new one such as TypeScript, NodeJS, Python and so much more tools.
